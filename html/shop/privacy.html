          <p>
             This policy establishes how we handle information we learn about you when you visit our website. Protecting the privacy and personal data of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. Protecting your privacy and your personal data is an important aspect of the way we create, organise and implement our activities on-line and off-line.

          <p>
             The specific practices outlined in this privacy statement apply to the Designer Paint Store website. Other bodies/entities linked to the Designer Paint Store website may have different practices, though the commitment to your privacy will always be the same. You are encouraged to review the privacy statements of other bodies/entities when visiting their website(s).

             Purpose Specifications and Data Collection
          </h2>
          <p>
             In general, you can browse the Designer Paint Store website without disclosing any information about yourself. If you visit the Designer Paint Store website to read or download information, we collect and store only the following information that is automatically recognised: the date and time, the originating IP address, the domain name, the type of browser and operating system used (if provided by the browser), the URL of the referring page (if provided by the browser), the object requested and the completion status of the request.
          </p>

             Cookies and Other Technologies
          </h2>
          <p>
             As described above, we sometimes collect anonymous information from visits to our site to help us provide better customer service. For example, we keep track of the domains from which people visit and we also measure visitor activity on the Designer Paint Store website, but we do so in ways that keep information anonymous. We use the information that we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different areas of our site, and to help us make the site more useful to visitors. This includes analysing these logs periodically to measure the traffic through our servers, the number of pages visited and the level of demand for pages and topics of interest. The logs may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time and in any way to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the data on our servers.
          </p>
          <p>
             We collect the anonymous information we mentioned above through the use of various technologies, one of which is called &quot;cookies&quot;. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive. For example, on a website with a login system (if users register for it), cookies are used to save the visitor&#39;s password so that it does not have to be entered at each new visit.
          </p>
          <p>
             This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want any transaction details used in this manner, you can disable your cookies.
